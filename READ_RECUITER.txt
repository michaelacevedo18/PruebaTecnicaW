Cordial greetings below I comment on points of the development carried out, a solution is created with 3 projects
developed in .Net in its version 6, the first of them is a console application for the test for the chessboard where
I assume the operation of the knight movements there I perform tests and print on console the moves and evaluate the 
different moves,  the second project is the console application for the point of consumption of the API (as a finding 
you have that the described method does not exist or that the API is out of operation so simulate the behavior of the 
API to be able to complete the test according to the request)In a third project, unit tests are carried out wishing 
that what was requested has been what was done, I am grateful for the opportunity and it will always be a pleasure to 
know about this company
